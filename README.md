# HTML-CSS-Crash-Course

I am working my way through getting oriented with GitHub.
I am loving the journey of learning to code and the wonderful relationships that I am making along the way.
24 November 2021 - I revisited this build today. Wow, have I come a long way in just a few short months. I quickly practiced by updating my build with all the new CSS features that came to mind.
